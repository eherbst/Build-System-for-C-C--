Docs and such are at http://abstract.cs.washington.edu/~eherbst/projects/build_system_for_c_cpp/; you can also contact me from there.

install
==========
- install ruby, rake, rgl (ruby graph library)
  - aptitude install ruby rubygems
  - gem install rake rgl
- add the rake executable to $PATH
- add " -I$BUILD_SYSTEM_DIR" to $RUBYOPT, where $BUILD_SYSTEM_DIR is the directory above build_system/

test
==========
- go to any dir under example_projects/ that has a Rakefile.rb
- `rake`
(At least one of these dirs is broken at the moment because the system can't handle a source file (ie .cpp -- .h is fine) in an external srcroot.)
